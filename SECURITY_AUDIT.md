# Security Audit Summary

## Automated Checks
- `npm audit` (Node dependencies) — no vulnerabilities reported.
- `bundle exec pod update --verbose` — blocked because CocoaPods refuses to run as root without `--allow-root`; native dependencies were not updated in this environment.
- `npm run lint` — completed with existing warnings unrelated to security (Number prototype extension, lint suppressions, formatting).
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — passed with the new Jest type declarations.

## Manual Review Highlights
- **Authentication & Secure Storage:** No authentication modules or secure storage integrations were present under `src/`; the application currently operates as a local demo without user credentials.
- **API Clients & Networking:** No outbound HTTP clients were identified in `src/` beyond local SQLite interactions. Background worker APIs now clamp untrusted event payloads and priority values before forwarding them to listeners.
- **Sensitive Logging:** Console warnings in the SQLite demo only surface aggregate or synthetic data; no personally identifiable or credential data is logged.

## Quick Wins Implemented
- Hardened the React Native bridge to validate native progress payloads, clamp task priorities, and reject blank cancellation identifiers before passing values to JavaScript workers.
- Enforced HTTPS-only traffic on Android by setting `android:usesCleartextTraffic="false"`.
- Restored App Transport Security defaults on iOS by disabling `NSAllowsLocalNetworking`.
- Added Jest type definitions and stricter TypeScript settings (`noImplicitAny`) to surface unsafe implicit typings during development.

## Outstanding Risks & Recommendations
- **iOS CocoaPods Updates:** Re-run `bundle exec pod update --verbose` on a local workstation (non-root) to ensure native dependencies are current and security patches are applied.
- **Local Development Impacts:** If legitimate local network traffic is required (e.g., debugging against emulators), configure ATS exceptions for specific hosts instead of the blanket `NSAllowsLocalNetworking` flag.
- **SQLite Demo Data:** The demo stores generated records in plaintext SQLite tables. While synthetic here, encrypt or secure sensitive datasets before adopting this pattern in production builds.

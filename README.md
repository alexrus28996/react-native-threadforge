# ThreadForge Demo Application

ThreadForge is a React Native showcase that demonstrates how to execute heavy native
workloads without blocking the JavaScript thread or the UI. It uses a custom native
module backed by a C++ thread pool to schedule background jobs while keeping the
foreground experience responsive.

This repository contains both the sample application (in the project root) and the
`react-native-threadforge` package (under `packages/`). The package exposes a typed
JavaScript API and bridges into native Android code via the JNI layer implemented in
C++.

## Features

- üîß Configurable native thread pool used for all heavy computation.
- üîÅ Queued tasks with priorities (low, normal, high).
- üõë Cooperative cancellation support for long-running jobs.
- ‚è∏Ô∏è One-line pause/resume controls to orchestrate bursts of native work.
- üìä Live stats for active, pending, and allocated worker threads.
- üßµ Sample UI with long-running simulations to prove the UI stays responsive while
  background jobs run in parallel.

## Why ThreadForge?

ThreadForge is designed as a production-ready alternative to ad-hoc "runOnQueue"
helpers or JS-only worker shims. It stands out because it:

- **Keeps the UI fluid** ‚Äì heavy work never touches the JS or main threads thanks to a
  modern C++ priority queue scheduler.
- **Ships a type-safe API** ‚Äì the exported TypeScript surface mirrors the native
  contract so you get autocompletion, linting, and compile-time validation.
- **Offers predictable control** ‚Äì you can cancel tasks, pause scheduling during
  critical UI interactions, and resume later without tearing anything down.
- **Minimizes overhead** ‚Äì tasks are serialized once and executed directly in native
  code, eliminating the JSON parsing and context switching overhead common in
  bridge-based implementations.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have completed the official
[React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
before continuing. You need Node.js 18+, the Android/iOS build tooling, and either an
emulator or a device connected to your machine.

## Installing Dependencies

From the project root install JavaScript dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you are developing on Android, also install the native dependencies by opening the
`android` directory in Android Studio once so that Gradle can sync the C++ build.

## Running the App

Open two terminals from the project root:

1. **Start Metro (JavaScript bundler)**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. **Launch the native application**
   ```bash
   # Android
   npm run android

   # iOS
   npm run ios
   ```

The UI contains several buttons that enqueue heavy work. Observe that the "UI Counter"
keeps incrementing smoothly while the background tasks are running.

## How It Works

- The JavaScript API lives in `packages/react-native-threadforge/src/index.ts` and
  serializes task descriptors before sending them over the native bridge. It also
  exposes helpers such as `cancelTask`, `pause`, and `resume` to control native
  execution directly from JS.
- On Android, the `ThreadForgeModule` Kotlin class manages a cached executor that calls
  into the JNI bindings exposed by `ThreadForgeJNI.cpp`.
- The JNI layer forwards the work to a C++ `ThreadPool` implementation that schedules
  tasks onto worker threads based on priority, keeping the UI thread free.

## API Overview

```ts
import { threadForge, TaskPriority } from 'react-native-threadforge';

await threadForge.initialize(6);

// Fire and await a heavy task
const result = await threadForge.runTask('prime-search', {
  type: 'HEAVY_LOOP',
  iterations: 1_000_000,
}, TaskPriority.HIGH);

// Temporarily pause execution (pending work stays in the queue)
await threadForge.pause();

// Cancel an in-flight task if the user navigates away
await threadForge.cancelTask('prime-search');

// Resume the queue when it is safe to continue
await threadForge.resume();

// Inspect how the pool is doing
const stats = await threadForge.getStats();

await threadForge.shutdown();
```

Every helper enforces initialization and returns Promises, making it trivial to hook
into React components, sagas, or async thunks.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter `UnsatisfiedLinkError` messages about missing `native*` functions,
run a clean rebuild of the Android project so the native library is recompiled:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
npm run android
```

For other build issues consult the React Native
[Troubleshooting guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting).
